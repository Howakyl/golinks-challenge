# Github Repo Finder

Input the name of a Github organization, and the app will return to you a list of that org's repositories!

### What data can be found from this search?

The app will list out the org's repos, sorted by star count. 
If you click the '+' button on the right hand side of a repo, a modal will open. This modal shows the most recent commits.

### What info is on the commits modal?

Commits are ordered by most recent commits. These will show their title, the committer, date created, and a hash that links to the commit on GitHub.

If you mouse-over the commit hash button, the browser will render a tooltip showing the entire commit hash.
